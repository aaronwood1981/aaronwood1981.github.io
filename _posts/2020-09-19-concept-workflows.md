When working through the concept of the "Gamebook Adventures", I spent some time figuring out how I wanted to deploy my first app (and hopefully others to follow). At first I really wanted to work with native iOS and Swift as the language is quite enjoyable to use and modern. However, despite these advantages I didn't want to be locked into the Apple ecosystem, and I'm not quite ready to build an independent framework to use on Android devices. I wound up choosing [Unity](https://unity.com) as the engine due to accessibility and relative ease of use. One of the assets I am fond of, and using in my projects is [Fungus](https://fungusgames.com/). Although I have built a great deal of independent logic outside of this asset, it is a great tool to automate and visualize flow of the novel. It also excels when there is a need to generate repetitive tasks. Hopefully as I become nearer to completion, there isn't any unintended side effect of a large, robust workflow.
